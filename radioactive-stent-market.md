<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radioactive Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Retrograde Stents</li><li>Antegrade Stents</li><li>Internal (double-J) Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The radioactive stent market encompasses various types, including retrograde stents, antegrade stents, and internal (double-J) stents. Retrograde stents are inserted from the bladder toward the kidney, facilitating drainage in obstructed pathways. Antegrade stents, on the other hand, are placed from the kidney down into the bladder. Internal stents, also known as double-J stents, are designed with a coiled shape to prevent migration and ensure patency in the ureters. Each type serves specific clinical needs in managing urinary tract obstructions.</p></p>
